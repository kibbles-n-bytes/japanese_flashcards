Japanese Flash Cards
===================

Allows for Japanese learners in training (though any language is technically fine) to practice with a unique, time-based flashcard program.

Version: 1.0b
Language: Java

This program simulates a deck of Japanese flash cards, allowing for the user to load custom-created decks from a file tree.

Decks can be semi-easily built in my currently bootstrapped Deck Builder application.

Features:

    English to Japanese or Japanese to English
    Kanji and Hiragana or Hiragana only
    Shuffling
    A timer to turn to the next card

The main function for the actual program is in "Vocabulary Trainer/src/VocabularyTrainerGUI.java" ! Decks can be built using the "Deck Builder" application. Decks are stored in the "decks" folder.

Note: Currently crashes on OS X during loading of cards.
